          I was born and raised in Franklin, TN. I earned a masters degree from the University of Alabama in 2014 and became a published geologist. Afterwards, I worked for a multinational oil company in Denver, CO until circumstances led me back to Nashville, TN and into the field of software development.

          From discovering the next oil reserve to building the next software program, my passion has always been problem solving. I've worked on problems ranging from figuring out how oil formed millions of years ago to how to drill the next well. Technology was always at the heart of the solution. Software development allows me to combine many of my passions into one field. My goal is to use programming for data analysis to maximize efficieny.

          When I'm not in the office I can be found spending time outdoors, hiking, fishing, golfing or skiing, or spending time with family and friends.
